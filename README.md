# Tag Generator for my Hugo blog

## Version 1

This project generates tags for my existing blog posts.

The script uses the [NLTK](https://www.nltk.org/) python library to analyze and extract meaningful tags.

## Version 2

This package will edit the markdown files to replace the existing tags with the newly generated list.

### Note: Working out some import issues, to run the program and run the tests successfully.
